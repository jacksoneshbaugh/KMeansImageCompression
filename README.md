# k-Means Image Compression

I created this code as a way to learn about the k-means clustering algorithm. It is heavily based on code from [this](https://towardsdatascience.com/clear-and-visual-explanation-of-the-k-means-algorithm-applied-to-image-compression-b7fdc547e410) article by Sebastian Charmot.

This project is exactly what its name says it is: an image compressor. Simply run the Python file, provide an input file, an output file name, and a k-value, and the algorithm will run. It's not quickâ€”it will take a bit. But, when finished, you'll find an image (with an x-y plane) exported.
